Visa Check (v2)
The /v2/visa/check endpoint provides a detailed breakdown of visa and entry requirements for one passport–destination pair. It returns structured information about:

Passport & destination details – country codes, names, continent, capital, currency, exchange info, population, area, phone code, time zone, and passport validity requirements.
Mandatory registration rules – e.g., e-Arrival, police registration, or other pre-travel forms, including color-coded status and official links.
Visa rules – primary and secondary entry policies (visa-free, visa required, visa on arrival, eVisa, eTA, etc.), with allowed duration of stay, color-coded category, and links to official sources if available.
The exception of primary entry policy.

How to display Visa Rules to end users
Use the primary_rule as the authoritative color (UI badge) and combine it with secondary_rule for a concise customer-facing line such as: “Visa on arrival / eVisa – 30 days”.

Situation	Condition	What to display	Duration used
Only primary rule exists	secondary_rule is absent	primary_rule – XXX days	primary_rule.duration
Both rules have durations	Both primary_rule.duration and
secondary_rule.duration are present	primary_rule / secondary_rule – XXX days	primary_rule.duration
Primary has no duration	primary_rule.duration is null/empty and secondary_rule.duration exists	primary_rule / secondary_rule – XXX days	secondary_rule.duration
Notes: “XXX days” is the duration chosen per the rules above. If neither rule has a duration, omit the days suffix (e.g., “Visa required / eTA”).

What is exception_rule?
An exception is a conditional rule that can override the primary policy for travelers who meet specific criteria (e.g., holding a valid visa/residence for another country, traveling in an organized tour, or meeting transit-waiver conditions). The API may include fields such as:

exception_rule.name and exception_rule.exception_type_name – the exception type.
exception_rule.full_text – human-readable condition(s).
exception_rule.country_codes – related countries referred to by the exception.
exception_rule.link – official source/details.
Display guidance: Show exceptions as a highlighted notice beneath the combined rule line, e.g., “Exception:  Visa waiver available for holders of US/CA visas”. Do not change the primary color badge unless your UI allows users to confirm they meet the exception criteria.

What is mandatory_registration?
Some destinations require travelers to complete a pre-arrival immigration/arrival form online (e.g., “e-Arrival”, “pre-registration”, “ED card”). This step is always free but mandatory for all (or most) travelers, and it is separate from visas or eVisas.

Show this near the top of your UI, e.g., “Mandatory registration: e-Arrival”.
Use the provided mandatory_registration.link so travelers complete the official form.
This does not replace a visa requirement; it’s an additional step.
Example: { "name": "e-Arrival", "color": "yellow", "link": "https://link.travel-buddy.ai/?link=...T3" }
